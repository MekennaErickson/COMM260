        <h1>Travel to Colorado!</h1>
        <p class="colorado-summary"> Colorado is home to some of the country's tallest mountains, and has the highest mean elevation of any U.S. state. Whether tourists come to the state as skiers flocking to Aspen and Vail, outdoor enthusiasts traveling through the Rocky Mountains or the Great Plains or fans of the rapidly developing pot tourism industry, the state's investments have paid off in the form of billions of tourism dollars per year.</p>
